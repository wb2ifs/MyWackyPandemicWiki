# MyWackyPandemicWiki
Welcome to my experiement in managing the knowledge that I discover about this pandemic. It's a continual work in progress that I'll update this TiddlyWiki at least once a week...maybe.

Start with the COVID-19Links index below
COVID-19_Prep_checklist was what I started with as the "clouds were gathering"
I'll put some additional featured content up as the spirit moves...

Why?
I'm doing this for myself because I find comfort in knowing what the real situation is. When I'm spun, gasslit, or out-right lied to, I get angry and frightened. This is my attempt to push back against all the disinformation and missinformation and the fear it creates.

Connect with me
You may connect with me via LinkedIn.com or Twitter, Instagram: @scipoet. I'm on Facebook but I use it sparingly because of the numerous security issues with that platform.
